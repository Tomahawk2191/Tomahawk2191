### Hi there, I'm Isaac!

I'm currently an undergraduate at **Northeastern University** studying **Computer Science and Game Development**. In my spare time, I love to play games that I can sink hundreds of hours into learning and iterating on.

If you're interested in contacting me for work or just to talk, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-polite/), or at polite.i@northeastern.edu
